## Implementing in-depth data analysis to fighting games matches.

Data analysis of 12 SFV matches between Daigo and Tokido using Tableau.

The "DvT.csv" dataset was collected manually by watching a [video of the matches](https://youtu.be/LLPUW1IAGwY) and recording each action.

**SURFACE ANALYSIS** - *Data analysis that can be done with the original dataset*

- Move hit rates
- Throw success rate
- Jump success rate

**DEEP ANALYSIS** - *Data analysis that requires a transformation of the original dataset*

- Combos
- Meaties / Stolen Turns
- Hit Confirms

**FUTURE ANALYSIS** - *Data analysis that either requires more data or more technology to properly implement*
- Health loss / chip damage*
- Projectile Throw Rate
- Distance walked
