# 01 - Preprocessing
## Preparing image datasets for object detection training.

_Process (WIP)_

_Find sprites -> sprite_trim_and_shift.py -> create .yaml file -> Run YARDS -> Run pngtojpg.py -> delete .png folders -> rename .jpg folders -> drop .yaml file in -> zip folder -> move onto training_


**Script** | **Description** |
--- | --- | 
sprite_trim_and_shift.py | Takes the raw sprites from a game, trims the white space, and creates color shifted copies. Can also resize sprites if necessary| 
yards.bat | Simple batch script used to run YARDS and generate synthetic data | 
pngtojpg.py | Converts the .png images generated by YARDS into smaller .jpg files |
