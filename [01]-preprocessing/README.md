# 01 - Preprocessing
## Preparing image datasets for object detection training.

_To train models on character movesets, you need to first create a large image dataset with each move in each image labeled. This is done automatically by creating folders for each moves' animations and running [YARDS (YOLO Artificial Retro-game Data Synthesizer
](https://github.com/faimSD/yards). YARDS will randomly take images for the moveset folders and paste them onto the stage backgrounds and automatically label them, creating a "synthetic" image dataset that resembles gameplay and can be used for training._

### Process
1. Obtain the necessary character sprites & backgrounds (`ken-sprites` & `stages` folders)
2. Manually split the frames of the animations into folders for each move (`ken-sprites`)
3. Run `sprite_trim_and_shift.py` (Will create `ken-sprites-shift` folder)
4. Create config.yaml file (`ken-config.yaml`)
5. Run YARDS command on that config file (`yards command.bat`, creates `ken-example` folder)
6. Run `pngtojpg.py` (Creates `train-jpg` and `val-jpg` folders inside `ken-example`)
7. Delete the current `train` and `val` folders
8. Rename `train-jpg` and `val-jpg` to "train" and "val" respectively
9. Create a data.yaml file (`ken-data.yaml`) if you haven't already
10. Zip the folder (`ken-example`)
11. Move onto training =]

**Script** | **Description** |
--- | --- | 
sprite_trim_and_shift.py | Takes the raw sprites from a game, trims the white space, and creates color shifted copies. Can also resize sprites if necessary| 
yards.bat | Simple batch script used to run YARDS and generate synthetic data | 
pngtojpg.py | Converts the .png images generated by YARDS into smaller .jpg files |
